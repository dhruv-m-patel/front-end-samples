# frontend-rendering-strategies

### Server Only Rendering

- This is a frontend rendering strategy where all rendered HTML is entirely provided by server

### Client Only Rendering

- This is a frontend rendering strategy in which all HTML is purely rendered in browser through the scripts

### Universal Rendering

- This is a rendering technique in which the markup required for the initial page load is supplied by the server and then the client takes care of the routing on client-side rendering subsequent pages through scripts.
